The purpose of this project is to show the abilities I have been learning during the course, it will show how it is applied on a real scenario website.
It was created to support different companies in my area to show the different companies and opportunities we have as a community.
It helps to solve a problem that many companies have, and it is the visibility they may have versus the visibility they have if there is a website in my city where people can go to see what company we have available that covers one of their needs.
I learned about the different options I have to create a responsive website.
